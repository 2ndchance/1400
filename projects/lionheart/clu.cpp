/*

SO, your wondering why there isn't any code in here, right,

long story short, after millions of compiler errors, found out it was linker errors, 
so in order to save myself and whoever compiles this to much trouble, all of the code is in the header file

nothin here except a sob story about a million errors, suicidal king not obeying orders to run away, 
decoys being a total mehhhh, when i thought they would be the best, and a Royal guard within their king die

so yea, sob story, you probably have to grade all of these so see ya later.


OH almost forgot, found this on accident, the function that moves a unit forward allows them to tele-port in straight lines, found this by accident when runnin code.
